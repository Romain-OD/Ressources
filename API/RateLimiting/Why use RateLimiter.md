Rate limiting is a crucial technique used in API design and implementation to manage the number of requests a client can make to an API within a certain timeframe. 

It serves several important purposes:

1. Prevent Abuse: Without rate limiting, a single client could potentially make a large number of requests in a short period, overwhelming the server and affecting the performance of the API for other users. This could lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks or simply degrade the quality of service for legitimate users.
2. Fair Usage: Rate limiting ensures that all users, including those with legitimate needs, have fair access to the API. It prevents any single user from monopolizing the API's resources, ensuring that the service remains available and responsive for everyone.
3. Cost Management: For APIs that are hosted on cloud platforms, rate limiting can help manage costs. By limiting the number of requests, you can control the amount of resources (like compute, storage, and bandwidth) that your API consumes, potentially reducing costs.
4. Improve API Performance: By limiting the number of requests, rate limiting can help improve the overall performance of the API. It reduces the load on the server, allowing it to handle requests more efficiently and respond faster to legitimate users.
5. Enhance Security: Rate limiting can also serve as a basic security measure. By limiting the number of requests, it makes it more difficult for malicious actors to perform brute-force attacks or to scrape data from the API.
6. Compliance and Legal Reasons: Some APIs are subject to legal or regulatory requirements that limit the number of requests that can be made. Rate limiting helps ensure compliance with these requirements.
7. Feedback and Monitoring: Rate limiting can provide valuable feedback to API users about their usage patterns. It can help identify potential issues, such as excessive usage that might indicate a problem with the client application.

.NET provide built-in midleware to implement rate limiter algorythms.
